# Welcome to your Jupyter Book

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

Here is a note!

And here is a code block:

```
e = mc^2
```

Now let's see if I can write mathematics:

First inline equation $x^2=1$.

Now display equation:

$$x^2-x=0.$$

What about this
\begin{equation}\label{eq01}
t3 + \left[7, 6, 1, 7142857142, 1, 6, 6, 1, 125313283, \ldots\right]
\end{equation}

Let's see if a reference to equation works here.
